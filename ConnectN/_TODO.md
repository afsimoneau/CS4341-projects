* Objective: Complete AlphaBetaAgent class

- Implement AlphaBetaAgent.go()
    - Perform minimax search w/ alpha-beta pruning
    - use ABAgent.get_successors()?
    - evaluation limited to 15s

** Study evaluation functions for non-terminal board states

* Design Document
- How did you test your agents?
- What did your tests reveal? Which heuristics turned out to the best among those your tried?
- How would you improve your solution? Heuristics, code structure, . . .
